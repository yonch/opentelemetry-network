//! Fast approximate division of `u64` by multiplying then right-shifting.
//!
//! Motivation. Integer division is relatively expensive on modern CPUs. Using Agner Fog's instruction tables [1]
//!   as reference, the 64-bit DIV instruction (unsigned divide, see [2] for instruction documentation) has a latency of
//!   35-88 cycles, and reciprocal throughput of 21-83 cycles/operation on the Skylake architecture (15 and 10 on Ice Lake). 
//!   Code that performs a lot of this type of division in tightly dependent instruction chains can benefit from cheaper 
//!   division.
//! 
//! For example, in some telemetry/monitoring use-cases, there are millions of events per second, each with a nanosecond-scale
//!   timestamp. The monitoring system wants to aggregate to seconds. Given a measurement, the code needs to quickly find which 
//!   1-second bin the measurement belongs to. When the telemetry streams have a minor amount of jitter from collection to aggregation,
//!   say up to 60 seconds (i.e., "close to real time"), the result needs to disambiguate the second a sample belongs to, but 
//!   the result does not need to be unique across all seconds since the epoch. For example, the low 16-bits of the division is 
//!   sufficient. The division can also be approximate: if the division puts every 999,999,998.5 nanoseconds together rather than
//!   exactly 1e9, the system still produces good aggregations in practice.
//! 
//! Other instruction combinations are much cheaper than DIV. For example 64-bit MUL (integer multiplication) and SHRX (shift right 
//!   without affecting flags):
//!    * MUL's latency is 3 cycles and reciprocal throughput is 1 on Skylake and Ice Lake
//!    * SHRX's latency is 1 cycle and reciprocal throughput is 0.5 on Skylake and Ice Lake
//! 
//! Idea. We can approximate the 64-bit division with a multiplication followed by a shift. To divide by D, if we find two 
//!   numbers M and S such that:
//!       D ~= 2^S / M                   (say up to an error of 0.00001%)
//!   then for a given x,
//!       x / D ~=  x * M / 2^S          (up to an error of (1 / (1 +- 0.00001%)), which would be close in practice to 0.00001%).
//! 
//! So how should we choose M and S? Given a value for S, we can compute
//!    M = ((double)2^S / D) (where M is a u32 or u64)
//! With the trucation to make M an integer, we have
//!    M = 2^S / D - epsilon      where epsilon in [0, 1]
//! 
//! Dividing the above by M and shuffling terms around, we can get the relative error:
//!    (2^S / M) / D   =   1 + epsilon / M
//! When 2^S is sufficiently larger than D, then M is large and the relative error (epsilon / M) is small.
//! 
//! So large S is advantageous for precision. However, we cannot choose S to be arbitrarily large, because we are working with 64-bit 
//!   arithmetic. 
//! 
//! The user specifies how many least-significant bits they need from the fast_div, B. After the shift, 64-S bits remain, so we need 
//!   64-S >= B. We could set S = 64 - B to be the largest amount.
//! 
//! The code below also fits M into a 32 bit value (nb, cannot see a reason why a u64 would be significanly less desireable).
//!   To get 2^S / D <= 2^32, we want D >= 2^(S-32), or log_2(D) >= S-32. The code computes
//!      S = min(64-B, floor(log_2(D))+32).    (because floor(log_2(D)) <= log_2(D))
//! 
//! Examples:
//!    Say we want to divide a nanosecond timestamp to timeslots of 5 seconds, i.e., 5e9 nanos, and the 
//!      application needs 16-bits of precision.
//! 
//!    We have D = 5e9, B = 16. 
//!         log_2(D) = 32.219280948873624
//!         floor(log_2(D)) = 32
//!         S = min(64-16, 32+32) = 48
//!         M = u32(2^48 / 5e9) = u32(56294.9953421312) = 56294
//!    The relative error is .9953421312 / 56294 ~ 0.0017%
//!    The division ends up being 2^S/M = 5000088405.703201, i.e., 5 seconds and around 88 microseconds
//! 
//!    Note that in the above example, a lot of precision is lost from casting to u32. If instead the code rounded to the nearest
//!      integer, we would have
//!         M = round(2^48 / 5e9) = round(56294.9953421312) = 56295
//!         2^S/M = 4999999586.29818, i.e., 5 seconds less 414 nanoseconds
//!         and the relative error would be less than one part per million (PPM)
//!  
//!    Also, if the code only required 8 bits from the result:
//!         D = 5e9, B = 8. 
//!         S = min(64-8, 32+32) = 56
//!         M = u32(2^56 / 5e9) = u32(14411518.807585588) = 14411518
//!         relative error is 0.807585588 / 14411518 ~ 5.6e-8, and 2^S/M is 5000000280.1875515, i.e., 5 seconds and 280 nanoseconds
//!         and with round() instead of u32(): 4999999933.242841 i.e., 5 seconds less 77 nanoseconds.
//! 
//! NB when using fast_div with time. With fast_div, the time interval in the divisor is changed up to a small epsilon, for example 
//!   5 seconds versus 5.000089 seconds as above. One side effect is that the boundaries between intervals also change, and do not land
//!   on full seconds. For example, when looking at nanoseconds since the Epoch (midnight, Jan 1, 1970), today's 5 second timeslots
//!   boundaries might land 3.5 seconds into the "round" 5 seconds. This is because the 89 microsecond difference really adds up over decades.
//!   Each application should consider whether this is acceptable.
